<h1>Week 01</h1>



<br><h2>Learning Activities & Resources</h2>

This week I created a very basic website that had at least 3 pages and included text and images. As It's been a long time since I've done any HTML coding, I realised I needed starter code to refresh my understanding of basic HTML structures.

As most websites have some sort of navigation bar, I wanted to learn how to create dropdown menu options within the nav bar, something I've never learnt before.

I also explored CSS grid layouts. This allowed me to understand how to display  content (images and text) and how to neatly align them. My assignment will be based on selling products, so it is important that images / text / objects align well on pages to give customers a good viewing experience.

<br><h2>Estimated Hours</h2>

I spent 4 hours this week on the subject (including the lecture videos, linked-in course and W3Schools for coding).


<br><h2>Content Insights</h2>

Reviewing basic HTML starter code has helped me reconnect with the language and to reinforce the importance of clean and correct coding structures. Learning how to create dropdown menus within the navigation bar has given me more confidence to try new things in web development, and to further improve my designing skills. This could then be used again in future projects. 

CSS grid design has enabled me to be able to create visual content that aligns well and flows easily. I feel that the user experience should be visually pleasing and easy to navigate.





<br><h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>

My future plans involve using web-design tools and technology to create my own website to sell products to the public, and everything I've learnt this week has been beneficial. 

It is important to understand the basics of website design, but also the ability to learn more than just the minimum to increase your future employabilty prospects.

I feel expanding on the basic knowledge I had of web-design and then building on those skills allowed me to expand my ability to create a basic functional website.
